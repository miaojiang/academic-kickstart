Hello! My name is Michael MJ Jiang.

I am an experienced real estate investor in Seattle. I have been investing in real estate since 2008 and have personally invested in rental properties, vacation homes, flips, new constructions, offices, and over 400 multi-family units.

I initially became a real estate broker for my own transactions, but quickly realized my passion in sharing my investment strategies with friends and clients and enabling them to build wealth and become financially secure through real estate.

I excel at working with both aspiring and expert real estate investors to find great investments and achieve their financial and life goals.

I also own a boutique property management firm in Seattle.
